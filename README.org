* Kafka disaster recovery with MirrorMaker 2

#+TOC: headlines

* Introduction

This repository includes example file for creating a disaster safe Kafka cluster.
The example configuration is

- a main-kafka cluster deployed with strimzi (https://strimzi.io)
- a dr-kafka cluster deployed with strimzi (https://strimzi.io)
- a MirrorMaker2 configuration to sync topics from main-kafka to dr-kafka

* Route sharding

We would like to expose routes created by strimzi to a separate ingress controller (aka router).
The are a little bit different between OpenShift 4 and 3.11.

** OpenShift 4.n

Create an ingress controller with the following options:

#+begin_src yaml
    routeSelector:
      matchLabels:
        strimzi.io/kind: Kafka
#+end_src

This ingress controller will select routes with a label ~strimzi.io/kind: Kafka~ .

We also do not want to publish kafka routes on the default ingress controller so we change the default configuration
with

#+begin_src sh
oc edit ingresscontrollers.operator.openshift.io default  -n openshift-ingress-operator
#+end_src
** OpenShift 3.11 (untested)
